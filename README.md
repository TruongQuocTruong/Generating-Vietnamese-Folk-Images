# Generating-Vietnamese-Folk-Images
The Graduation Thesis


One of the trending topics in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general and Computer Vision specifically is Image Generation. Several models such as Generative Adversarial Network, Neural Style Transfer, Variational Autoencoder, and Diffusion Model have been developed to effectively tackle image generation problems. However, these models require significant computational power, resource availability, and training time. The challenge arises in finding ways to handle image generation problems with reduced computational requirements and training time, while being flexible and adaptable to limited resources. This serves as the basis for the emergence of Latent Diffusion Models - a spatially implicit diffusion model, as introduced in the work "High-Resolution Image Synthesis With Latent Diffusion Models."

Vietnamese art embodies cultural values and the spirit of the nation, including the traditional folk paintings, which are considered a unique beauty of the Vietnamese people. Is it feasible to leverage the support of AI to generate and transform images in the artistic style of Vietnamese folk paintings? The aim is to elevate their value and make them more accessible to everyone, while keeping up with the trends of image generation. Through research and surveys, I have applied Latent Diffusion Models to address the problem of generating and transforming input images into the styles of Vietnamese folk paintings.

The implementation process includes the following steps: understanding and studying the image generation methods and mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models; constructing a dataset of Vietnamese folk paintings; fine-tuning the model on the new dataset; combining other techniques such as inpainting for data processing, salient object detection for background processing, and high-resolution methods for enhancing image quality. Finally, a thorough evaluation and survey of the results will be conducted.
